# Lottery Number Generator

This Python script simulates a lottery draw by generating random numbers. It includes the following functionalities:

```picknumbers()```: Generates a list of 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 59.

```newdraw()```: Simulates a new lottery draw by generating 6 random numbers.

```checknumbers()```: Continuously generates new draws until a winning ticket is found.

## Usage
1.  Run the script using Python:

        python lottery_numbers.py

3.  Follow the prompts to select the type of lottery game (e.g., Cash Five, Powerball, Mega Millions) and the number of tickets to generate.
4.  The script will output individual text files for each lottery game with the generated numbers.
5.  For Powerball, you can also analyze winning number history and prevent previously winning numbers from being randomly generated.

## Example Output
```Draw 1: No Jackpot
Draw 2: No Jackpot
...
Draw 100: No Jackpot
Jackpot!
```
Feel free to customize and use this script for your own lottery fun!
